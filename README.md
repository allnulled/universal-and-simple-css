**Universal and simple CSS.**

## Why?

To not having to remember things.

## How?

Mapping directly classes to the rules.

## What?

Yes.

Instead of random abbreviations, this is to use simple CSS classes that refer directly to the rules it applies.

The result of using this instead of [Bootstrap](#) or [Materialize](#) or others is that your HTML code stands *superverbose*.

## So?

Add it to your project and start coding.

## Ehm...

I am not going to put the list. Go to the script and check it out if you want.

Free. Do what you want.
